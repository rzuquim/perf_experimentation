# Performance Experiments

Projects to host micro benchmarks for the technologies I am using.

## Contributing

I prefer [TBD](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) to preserve a linear history. So please, always rebase before the PR.

The commit messages should follow the
[ Angular commit conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
You might find useful to use the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/) tool to enforce the correct format.

NOTE: Please, keep your commits small and let the reviewer choose to squash them or not.
